# QFileWatcher
Watches for file changes and print new pdf files. (Windows only!)

You can create as many watchers as you want. For each watcher, a printer is selected from which the new PDF files will be printed automatically. In addition a folder is selected into which the files will be moved after printing.

You must select the path to the PDFtoPrinter.exe which you can get from: http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/pdftoprinter.html. This is the most easy way to print pdf files silent without any printer dialogs.
